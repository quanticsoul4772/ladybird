This file contains a custom test signature for YARA rule verification.

CUSTOM_MALWARE_SIGNATURE_12345

This signature should be detected by a custom YARA rule defined in:
/etc/sentinel/rules/custom.yar

The rule should match the string "CUSTOM_MALWARE_SIGNATURE_12345" and
trigger a malware alert with the rule name "Detect_Test_String".

This demonstrates that Sentinel can load and use custom YARA rules
provided by users or administrators.
