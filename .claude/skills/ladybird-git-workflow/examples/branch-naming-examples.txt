## ❌ Bad Branch Names

### Too Generic

feature/new-feature
fix/bug
update
changes
work
dev

### No Category Prefix

css-grid-support         # Missing feature/ prefix
memory-leak             # Missing fix/ prefix
fingerprinting          # Missing sentinel/ prefix

### Unclear Purpose

my-branch
test
temp
wip
asdf
feature123

### Too Long

feature/implement-the-complete-css-grid-layout-specification-with-all-features-and-properties

### Special Characters

feature/css_grid        # Use hyphens, not underscores
feature/CSS-Grid        # Use lowercase
fix/bug#123            # Don't include issue numbers
feature/grid+flexbox   # Avoid special chars

### Personal References

john-doe/css-grid      # No personal names
my-feature-branch
johns-wip

### Dates in Names

feature/css-grid-2024-11-01
fix/memory-leak-nov-2024

### Version Numbers

feature/grid-v1.0
fix/crash-1.2.3

### Vague Descriptions

feature/improvements
fix/issues
update/stuff
refactor/things

## Branch Naming Conventions Summary

### Format

{type}/{short-descriptive-name}

### Types

- feature/     - New functionality
- fix/         - Bug fixes
- refactor/    - Code restructuring
- perf/        - Performance improvements
- test/        - Test additions
- docs/        - Documentation
- ci/          - CI/CD changes
- build/       - Build system changes
- experiment/  - Experimental work
- research/    - Research/prototyping
- sentinel/    - Fork-specific security features (alternative to feature/)

### Naming Rules

1. Use lowercase
2. Separate words with hyphens
3. Be descriptive but concise
4. Use nouns, not verbs ("grid-support" not "add-grid")
5. Avoid special characters (!@#$%^&*()+=)
6. No spaces
7. No dates or version numbers
8. No personal attribution

### Examples by Component

LibWeb features:
- feature/css-grid-support
- feature/canvas-rendering-context
- feature/web-audio-api

LibJS features:
- feature/async-generators
- feature/weak-refs
- feature/private-class-fields

Services:
- feature/request-pooling
- feature/image-decoder-webp
- sentinel/url-security-analyzer

UI:
- feature/dark-mode
- feature/developer-tools
- fix/qt-menu-crash

Build/Meta:
- build/upgrade-clang
- ci/add-fuzzing-tests
- docs/update-coding-style

---

## Special Cases

### Multi-Component Changes

Use primary component:
- feature/webgl2-implementation (even if touches multiple components)
- sentinel/fingerprinting-detection (covers WebContent + Sentinel + LibWeb)

Or use descriptive name:
- refactor/multi-process-ipc
- perf/end-to-end-optimization

### Upstream Sync Branches

fix/upstream-api-changes
fix/resolve-merge-conflicts
merge/upstream-2024-11

### Hotfixes

hotfix/security-vulnerability
hotfix/critical-crash
hotfix/release-1.0.1

### Backports

backport/fix-to-release-1.0
backport/security-patch

---

## Fork-Specific Patterns

This fork uses longer-lived milestone branches:

sentinel-milestone-0.3-phase-1
sentinel-milestone-0.3-phase-2
sentinel-milestone-0.4-phase-1
sentinel-milestone-0.4-phase-4
sentinel-milestone-0.4-phase-5

These represent multi-day/week development efforts
for major Sentinel features, not typical upstream workflow.
