### Complex Feature Development

3. Delegate to @cpp-core for implementation
4. Route to @security for security review
5. Assign @fuzzer for testing
6. Hand off to @docs for documentation

### Security Investigation
1. @security performs initial analysis
2. Use brave-search for CVE/research
3. @fuzzer creates test cases
4. @cpp-core implements fixes
5. @reviewer validates changes

## Decision Framework
- Use unified-thinking:make-decision for architecture choices
