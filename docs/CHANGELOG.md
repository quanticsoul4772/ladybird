## Milestone 0.4 Phase 2 & 3 - ML Malware Detection & Federated Intelligence (2025-11-01)

Complete implementation of ML infrastructure and federated threat sharing.

### Phase 2: ML Malware Detection

**Features**:
- TensorFlow Lite integration with automatic fallback to heuristic mode
- ML stub (simulated 6→16→2 neural network) for testing without TFLite
- Shannon entropy calculation for packed malware detection
- PE structure analysis (header anomalies, import table, code-to-data ratio)
- Suspicious string detection (URLs, IPs, registry keys, API calls)
- Prediction with confidence scoring and threat categories

**Components**:
- `Services/Sentinel/MalwareML.{h,cpp}`: Core ML detector with 6-feature extraction
- `Services/Sentinel/CMakeLists.txt`: TFLite detection with USE_ML_STUB fallback
- `docs/TENSORFLOW_LITE_INTEGRATION.md`: Integration guide for production deployment

**Testing**:
- ✅ Complete - All 6/6 tests passing
- ML stub weight initialization fixed
- Heuristic detection fully operational as fallback to TensorFlow Lite

### Phase 3: Federated Threat Intelligence

**Features**:
- Bloom filter for 100M threat hashes (143 MB, 10 hash functions)
- IPFS threat feed synchronization (mock + real IPFS daemon support)
- Federated learning with differential privacy (ε=0.1, Laplace/Gaussian noise)
- Privacy-preserving gradient aggregation with k-anonymity (min 100 participants)
- Gradient clipping for bounded sensitivity (L2 norm ≤ 1.0)
- ThreatFeed integration with category-based scoring

**Components**:
- `Services/Sentinel/BloomFilter.{h,cpp}`: Space-efficient threat hash storage
- `Services/Sentinel/ThreatFeed.{h,cpp}`: Threat management with bloom filter
- `Services/Sentinel/IPFSThreatSync.{h,cpp}`: IPFS-based decentralized threat sharing
- `Services/Sentinel/FederatedLearning.{h,cpp}`: Privacy-preserving ML aggregation

**Testing**:
- ✅ TestBloomFilter: 10/10 tests passed
  - Basic operations, serialization, merging
  - False positive rate validation (< 5%)
  - Stress test with 10,000 items
  - Federated learning gradient privatization
  - IPFS mock threat synchronization

**Privacy Guarantees**:
- Differential privacy with ε=0.1 (strong privacy)
- K-anonymity with minimum 100 participants
- Gradient clipping to prevent information leakage
- Local training only, shared gradients not raw data
