# Upstream Merge and Memory Leak Test Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully merged 22 commits from upstream LadybirdBrowser/ladybird and fixed the memory leak test script to use proper vcpkg configuration.

---

## Part 1: Upstream Merge (22 Commits)

### Merge Process

1. **Stashed local changes** (Days 29-32 work in progress)
2. **Switched to master branch**
3. **Fetched from upstream**: `git fetch upstream`
4. **Merged upstream/master**: 22 new commits integrated

### Merge Conflicts Resolved

#### Conflict 1: Services/RequestServer/Request.h
**Issue**: HEAD had `#include <RequestServer/SecurityTap.h>`, upstream removed it
**Resolution**: Kept HEAD version (required for Sentinel)

#### Conflict 2: Services/RequestServer/Request.cpp (line 484-491)
**Issue**: HEAD had network identity audit logging, upstream didn't have it
**Resolution**: Kept HEAD version (required for Sentinel audit trail)

#### Conflict 3: UI/Qt/CMakeLists.txt (line 23-28)
**Issue**: HEAD linked `sentinelservice`, upstream didn't
**Resolution**: Kept HEAD version (required for Sentinel UI integration)
**Note**: Removed obsolete `lagom_copy_runtime_dlls()` (replaced by `lagom_windows_bin()` in upstream)

### Upstream Changes Integrated

**WebGL Improvements**:
- WebGL2's getBufferSubData() implementation
- WebGL2's readPixels with byte offset argument
- Pixel (un)pack buffer bindings storage
- Framebuffer data retention fixes

**LibJS Optimizations**:
- Precomputed register/constant/local counts in Executable
- Callee execution context allocation in call handler
- Module bindings strict mode assumption

**Windows Platform Support**:
- WinSock2 closesocket() in PosixSocketHelper
- Windows runtime config helpers
- Windows CA cert store integration
- Stubbed BrowserProcess/Process methods for Windows
- Helper process binaries moved to bin/ instead of libexec/

**RequestServer Refactoring**:
- RequestPipe abstraction for request data transfer
- ReadStream abstraction for reading request data

**Other**:
- ListItemMarkerBox content calculation crash prevention
- MonotonicTime precision increase on Windows
- CSS calc() nesting simplification fixes
- DashedIdent value type implementation

### Merge Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Merge upstream/master - integrate 22 new commits

Conflicts resolved:
- Services/RequestServer/Request.h: Kept SecurityTap include (Sentinel)
- Services/RequestServer/Request.cpp: Kept network audit logging (Sentinel)
- UI/Qt/CMakeLists.txt: Kept sentinelservice link (Sentinel)

Upstream changes include:
- WebGL2 improvements (getBufferSubData, readPixels)
- LibJS bytecode optimizations
- Windows platform improvements
- RequestPipe abstraction for request data transfer

All Sentinel features preserved during merge."
```

## Part 2: Memory Leak Test Fix

### Problem Identified

The `scripts/test_memory_leaks.sh` script was failing with:

```
CMake Error at AK/CMakeLists.txt:70 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "simdutf"
```

### Root Cause Analysis

Launched 4 parallel agents to investigate:

1. **Agent 1 (simdutf dependency)**: Identified that simdutf is a REQUIRED dependency used for SIMD-accelerated Unicode operations in AK (Application Kit). It's available in vcpkg but wasn't being configured.

2. **Agent 2 (test script analysis)**: Found that the script manually invokes CMake with sanitizer flags but doesn't configure the vcpkg toolchain, causing dependency resolution to fail.

3. **Agent 3 (vcpkg configuration)**: Confirmed that simdutf 7.4.0 is listed in vcpkg.json and should be automatically available, but the script bypasses the normal CMake preset system.

4. **Agent 4 (existing build configs)**: Discovered that Ladybird has an official "Sanitizer" CMake preset that properly configures vcpkg, ASAN, and UBSAN.

### Solution Implemented

**Modified**: `scripts/test_memory_leaks.sh` (lines 28-40)

**Before** (manual configuration):
```bash
BUILD_DIR="Build/asan"
if [ ! -d "$BUILD_DIR" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR"
    cd "$BUILD_DIR"

    cmake ../.. \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g" \
        -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g" \
        -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined" \
        -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined"

    cd ../..
fi
```

**After** (using Sanitizer preset):
```bash
BUILD_DIR="Build/sanitizers"
if [ ! -d "$BUILD_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Using CMake Sanitizer preset (includes vcpkg, ASAN, UBSAN)..."

    cmake --preset Sanitizer

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "CMake configuration failed!"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Proper vcpkg integration**: All dependencies (simdutf, etc.) automatically installed
2. **Uses official configuration**: Matches CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. **Sanitizer triplets**: Uses special vcpkg triplets for sanitizer-compatible library builds
4. **Maintainable**: Future dependency changes in vcpkg.json automatically handled
5. **Consistent**: Same build configuration across development and testing

### Build Progress

Memory leak test script now running in background:
- **Status**: Configuring with Sanitizer preset ‚úÖ
- **Progress**: vcpkg installing 40+ dependencies (angle, brotli, curl, ffmpeg, icu, etc.)
- **Expected time**: 30-60 minutes for first-time dependency build
- **Log**: `/tmp/memory_leak_test_run.log`

## Testing Status

### Upstream Merge
- ‚úÖ **Merge completed successfully**
- ‚úÖ **All conflicts resolved**
- ‚úÖ **Sentinel features preserved**
- ‚úÖ **Changes committed to master**
- ‚úÖ **Feature branch restored** (sentinel-phase5-day29-security-fixes)
- ‚úÖ **Stashed changes restored** (Days 29-32 work)

### Memory Leak Tests
- ‚úÖ **Script fixed to use Sanitizer preset**
- ‚úÖ **vcpkg configuration working**
- üîÑ **Dependencies installing** (in progress)
- ‚è≥ **Build pending** (waiting for dependencies)
- ‚è≥ **Test execution pending**

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Wait for memory leak test build to complete (~30-60 minutes)
2. Review ASAN/UBSAN results when tests finish
3. Address any memory leaks found

### Short-Term
1. Consider merging master into feature branch to stay current
2. Push updated master to origin/master
3. Continue with Day 33 implementation if desired

### Long-Term
1. Regularly pull from upstream to stay current
2. Use the fixed memory leak script for ongoing testing
3. Integrate memory leak tests into CI/CD

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use CMake presets**: They properly configure vcpkg and dependencies
2. **vcpkg integration is critical**: Manual CMake flags miss dependency configuration
3. **CI/CD configurations are gold**: They show the correct way to build
4. **Parallel agent investigation**: Quickly identified root cause from multiple angles
5. **Git workflow protection**: Upstream push disabled prevents accidents

## Commands Reference

### Upstream Sync Workflow
```bash
# Stash current work
git stash push -m "Work in progress"

# Switch to master
git checkout master

# Pull from upstream
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

# Resolve conflicts (if any)
git add <resolved_files>
git commit -m "Merge upstream/master"

# Switch back to feature branch
git checkout <feature-branch>

# Restore work
git stash pop
```

### Memory Leak Testing
```bash
# Run memory leak tests (now uses Sanitizer preset automatically)
./scripts/test_memory_leaks.sh

# Monitor progress
tail -f /tmp/memory_leak_test_run.log

# Check ASAN logs
ls -la test_results/memory_leaks/
```
