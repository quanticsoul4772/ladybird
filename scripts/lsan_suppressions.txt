# LeakSanitizer Suppressions
# Add known library leaks here that are not Sentinel bugs
#
# Format: leak:function_name_pattern
#
# Example suppressions (uncomment if needed):
#
# SQLite allocations (if using static SQLite)
# leak:sqlite3_*
#
# Qt framework allocations (if using Qt)
# leak:QObject::*
# leak:QString::*
#
# Standard library one-time allocations
# leak:std::__once_callable
#
# YARA library allocations
# leak:yr_*
#
# Add Sentinel-specific suppressions below as needed:
